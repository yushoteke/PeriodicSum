1. test euclidean_process with big number no overflow
2. test continued_fraction_approximation with big number no overflow
3. enumerate over small values of num,den,N
4. test typemin(Int8) for denominator and similar 
5. initialize summer with Int8 type and let N be Int64, check results
6. randomly sample num,den,N around 100k range and test
7. initialize with different types
